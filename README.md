This project develops an easy-to-use, voice-controlled assistant for seniors. 
Features include a simplified interface, health reminders, and customizable settings. 
The system uses advanced voice recognition to accommodate diverse speech patterns. 
It ensures information accuracy through rigorous data analysis and testing. 
The assistant tracks health data over time and includes an initial quiz, with periodic reassessments, to gauge the user's health, relationships, diet, and emotional state. 
This personalized approach allows the assistant to adapt to changing needs, enhancing the overall user experience and supporting both physical and mental health management for seniors.
